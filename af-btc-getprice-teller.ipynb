The price is then converted to an integer type and returned as a string.\n\nThe class also has a method called play_voice that takes parameters for the voice gender (sex), speaking rate (rate), the Bitcoin price string (btc_price_str), and a flag to indicate whether to save the TTS output to a file (save).\n\nThe method uses the pyttsx3 engine to set the voice gender and speaking rate. It then uses the engine to speak the Bitcoin price string and run the TTS engine to output the speech. If the save flag is set to \"yes\", the method also saves the TTS output to a file.\n\nOverall, this class allows you to get the current price of Bitcoin from the CoinDesk API and have it spoken out loud using TTS while providing options to customize the voice, speaking rate, and save the TTS output to a file.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nclass get_BTC_price_and_Tell:\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        # creating tts engine for pyttsx\n        self.engine = pyttsx3.init()\n\n    def get_price(currency):\n        # requesting bitcoin chart price from coindesk api\n        r = requests.get(' https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json')\n        # creating json/dictionary oject out of json string\n        data = json.loads(r.text)\n        # fetching bitcoin price inside the dictionary keys\n        btc_price = data['bpi'][currency]['rate']\n        # converting the data type of the price to integer format\n        btc_price = int(float(btc_price.replace(',', '')))\n        # showing the text as output in console\n        btc_price_str = \"bitcoin price is {} {}\".format(btc_price, currency)\n        print(btc_price_str)\n        return btc_price_str\n\n    def play_voice(self,sex,rate,btc_price_str,save):\n        \n\n        if sex == 'male':\n            sex_numb = 0\n        elif sex == 'female':\n            sex_numb = 1\n        voices = self.engine.getProperty('voices')       #getting details of current voice\n        self.engine.setProperty('voice', voices[sex_numb].id)  #changing index, changes voices. o for male\n        # engine.setProperty('voice', voices[0].id)  #changing index, changes voices. o for male\n        # engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)   #changing index, changes voices. 1 for female\n\n        # old_rate = self.engine.getProperty('rate')   # getting details of current speaking rate\n        self.engine.setProperty('rate', rate)\n        \n        # making the order to say a sentence\n        self.engine.say(btc_price_str)\n        \n        # signaling the engine to read the income text\n        self.engine.runAndWait()\n\n        if save.lower() == \"yes\":\n            self.engine.save_to_file(btc_price_str, fileName())        \n\n\n    \n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-24T04:22:55.478904Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-24T04:22:55.478305Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-24T04:22:55.594667Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-24T04:22:55.593456Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-24T04:22:55.478868Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This code gets the current price of BTC in USD using the \"get_BTC_price_and_Tell\" module. \n\nIt then creates an instance of the \"get_BTC_price_and_Tell\" class called \"btc_teller\". \n\nFinally, it calls the \"play_voice\" method of the \"btc_teller\" object, passing in parameters for the desired voice sex (\"female\"), speech rate (120), the BTC price string obtained earlier, and whether to save the voice output (\"Yes\").","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"btc_price_str = get_BTC_price_and_Tell.get_price(currency=\"USD\")\nbtc_teller = get_BTC_price_and_Tell()\nbtc_teller.play_voice (sex=\"female\", rate=120, btc_price_str=btc_price_str, save=\"Yes\")","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This code is using a module called \"get_BTC_price_and_Tell\" to retrieve the current price of Bitcoin in Euros.
